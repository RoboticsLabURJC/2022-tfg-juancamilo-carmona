# What's the project about?
Before we start, I think it's a good idea to answer a question: whats's the project about? what are we going to talk about in this blog during the next couple of months? 
The main topic of this project is clear: Autonomous 
driving using reinforcement learning. We will study about how a robot interacts in a certain enviroment with different algothms and programs and compare them with a reinforcement trained algorithm see how much better reinforment learning actually is and what beneefits and disadvantages does it offer in comparation to other options.

#Where are we doing this?
Autonomous driving is something you prabably will end up trying on a real robot. For this simple reason I think it's an accurate decision to work with a realistic simulator. After some research my choice was to use CARLA as my main simulator, CARLA is a very realistic simulator developed in Barcelona and meant to develop, trainin, and validate autonomous system with a really realistic aproach. I think there couldn't be any better choice
