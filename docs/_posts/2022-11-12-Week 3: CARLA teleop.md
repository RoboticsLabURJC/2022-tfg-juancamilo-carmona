# Week 3: CARLA teleop

For this week our task will be to programm a simple teleop on ROS2 that can control a vehicle on CARLA. 

## vehicle launching
Before we start developing the teleop, we need to spawn a vehicle that can be controlled. To do this we will use the launchers that carla_ros_bridge offers us in it's code
