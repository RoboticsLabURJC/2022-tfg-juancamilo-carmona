<<<<<<< HEAD

My name is Juan Camilo Carmona Sanchez and I'm a final year student studying Software Robotics Engineering at King Juan Carlos University in Madrid. Throughout my life, I've been an enthusiast of both Robotics and Biology and consequently, I also have an interest in Biorobotics, Biomechanics, and Biohacking - fields I hope to dedicate my life to once I graduate. I consider myself a transhumanist who loves learning and solving all kinds of challenges.

In my free time, I usually work on projects related to the things I love and post them on my social media, which I've linked below if you're interested in taking a look.
